## Aviatrix Site to Cloud VPN on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start sets up a highly available, Aviatrix Site to Cloud VPN service that includes an AVX Controller and AVX Gateways on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 10 minutes. You can deploy the controller in a new or existing virtual private cloud (VPC).

Aviatrix Site to Cloud VPN makes it easy to connect on-premises data centers, sites, and branch locations to the cloud. By deploying this Quick Start, you can readily connect to VPCs on the AWS Cloud with enhanced security, and access your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, applications, and services. 

After youâ€™ve used this Quick Start to deploy the AVX Controller in one of your VPCs, the Aviatrix Site to Cloud VPN wizard in the controller provides step-by-step workflow to deploy and configure AVX Gateways for building site to cloud connections.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying the AVX Controller into a new VPC on AWS
- Deploying the AVX Controller into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
