## Aviatrix Orchestrator for AWS Transit Gateway on AWS

This Quick Start automatically deploys an Aviatrix Controller for enabling Aviatrix Orchestrator for AWS Transit Gateway into a new or existing virtual private cloud (VPC) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 10 minutes.  

The Aviatrix Controller is a centralized control plane for orchestration and management of various networking and connectivity solutions on AWS. One key feature of the Aviatrix Controller is the Aviatrix Orchestrator, which orchestrates and manages end-to-end connectivity by using AWS Transit Gateway. AWS Transit Gateway, in turn, simplifies VPC-to-VPC connection and consolidates edge connections.

This Quick Start is for users who manage large numbers of VPCs, and who want to use AWS Transit Gateway to connect them with high performance and security.

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
